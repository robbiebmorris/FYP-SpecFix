This directory stores all datasets used in the experiments.

The datasets are stored in the following format:

```
humaneval.jsonl
humaneval_pilot.jsonl
humaneval_woe.jsonl
humaneval_woe_pilot.jsonl
```

`xxx_pilot` means the dataset is a pilot dataset, including the first 50 cases.
`xxx_woe` means the dataset excludes examples.

The dataset is stored in the following format:

```
{
  "requirement", # the desription of the task
  "task_id", 
  "canonical_solution", 
  "llm_generated_inputs": [ # the inputs generated by the LLM using for ambiguity detection
    {
      "deepseek-v3",
      "qwen2.5-coder-32b-instruct"
    }
  ],
  "input_output_examples", # input-output pair of embedded examples in requirement
  "inputs", # the inputs in original dataset
  "outputs" # the outputs in original dataset
}
```
